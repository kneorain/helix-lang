**Ordering is DAG order, not just parallel.** `CompilerInstance::_sema`
runs each fid's pipeline in reverse import-tree order. I needs it (source
overlay complete before re-export folds). T needs it (an imported file's
nodes are settled before the importer READS them). X needs it (an imported
expression-bodied function's return slot is filled by its own TU). Do not
change the loop.

Pipeline, as scheduled by `Sema.k`:

    P -> I -> E -> V -> N -> T (TypeResolve, RedeclMerge, ChainBinding)
      -> C (ConstraintExtraction, TypeCycleCheck, ExprTyper, ShadowCheck, ...)
      -> L -> M1 -> M2

### 2.1 P parse [DONE]

POST: every DC has a frozen table; `out_of_line` collected.
INVARIANT: frozen tables are never mutated again by ANY later phase.

Statement-scope named decls (`class Local`, `fn inner` inside a body) are
linked into the enclosing executable DC's `dc_decls`
(`StmtParse::_attach_local_decl`, never for the TU). `_build_symbols`
indexes their BODIES through `_index_local_scopes` so members have tables;
their NAMES go in no table (N's lexical stack / T's `ltypes` own them).
`Self` in expression and pattern position lexes as `BiSelf` and parses as
an ordinary `NamedIdentExpr` head; `Self<...>` never takes generic args.

    [MISSING] `TypeCastExpr::cast_mode` (Default / Static / Const /
    Unsafe). Only `is_unsafe` is recorded today; `as static` / `as const`
    parse but are not distinguishable by sema.                        (spec 3)
    [MISSING] Named call arguments have no node; every argument is
    positional until one exists.                                      (spec 8)
    [MISSING] `<T: type>` -> `GenericParamKindBound::Duck`.
    [MISSING] `PointerType::is_unsafe` stamped from the `unsafe` qual. (spec 2)

### 2.2 I ImportResolution [DONE, IMPORTS.md §4]

path->fid is the PP's; keys re-intern once at the boundary; overlay cells
are thin and multi-target; plain imports bind ONE name (the ModuleDecl);
import everything, carry the visibility fact, diagnose at use; two walls
against accidental transitivity; NO unfold pass, NO fwd-decl synthesis.

Selective and symbol-path imports of a name the source RE-EXPORTS
(`import foo::{bar}` where foo `pub import`s bar) probe the source's
overlay on a table miss (`_reexported_cell`). Wildcards fold re-exports.

### 2.3 E Expand [PARTIAL]

`RequiresDesugar` runs. Macro expansion and eval lowering do not.

### 2.4 V Verify [DONE]

Six independent structural checks. Errors hard-stop before N.

### 2.5 N NameResolution [DONE]

`Sema/Resolve/NameResolution.k`. Two halves, one pass.

(a) Decl validation over frozen cells: link `Redeclarable` chains for the
five type kinds + modules, retarget canonical at the definition, diagnose
redefinition and conflicting kinds, attach `out_of_line` defs, populate
`sc.well_known`. **Specializations are skipped**: their own chains link in
T on canonical spec args (#12). Function chains are R's (§2.6a).

(b) Binding: every `NamedIdentExpr` head gets `resolved_decl` or
`candidate_cell`. Order: lexical locals stack (innermost first) ->
`sc->lookup.unqualified(cur_dc)` -> miss. Redecl chains collapse to the
representative; specializations never compete for a name; a genuine
overload set goes through whole.

    [DONE] Lexical stack holds: params, generic params of the enclosing
    function/type, statement binders (`for`, `catch`, destructuring,
    `case var n`, context bindings), body `var`s (declared AFTER their
    initializer), and statement-scope named decls (`fn inner`, `class
    Local`, `type X` -- declared BEFORE their body, so recursion binds).
    C-style `for var i = ...` scopes `i` to the loop.
    [DONE] `Self` (BiSelf) in expression position binds to the enclosing
    type body's decl -- the class/struct/... or the ExtensionDecl.
    [REMOVED] The bare-ffi miss gate. ffi imports bring real decls now
    (IMPORTS.md §5), so an unqualified miss is a miss in every TU.
    [DONE, by design] N does NOT bind: chain steps (ChainBinding);
    ConstructorPattern heads and bare `case n` (pattern checking);
    named-initializer field names (X); attribute ARGUMENTS.
    [DONE] The explicit-qualifier rule (R049), below.

**The explicit-qualifier rule.** Kairo has no implicit `this->`. A name that a
TYPE scope answers, used from inside a function or closure body, is a MEMBER
ACCESS with the qualifier left off, and it is an error: `self.x` for an
instance member, `Self::x` (or the type's own name) for a static one. The ONE
exception is a name that denotes a SCOPE -- a nested type, a type alias, a
nested module -- because naming a type is not an access through an object;
`Nested { .. }` inside a method means `Self::Nested` and stays legal.

Two mechanisms: N's `_fn_depth` counter plus `_ext_target` (probed AFTER the
DC chain); T's `_lookup_in_selfs` for type position. Field defaults and enum
variant values keep the type body's scope (`_fn_depth` resets to 0 on entry
to every type scope).

**Lang items are bound by fid + path, not by unqualified name** [DECIDED,
MISSING]. `_bind_well_known` walks the TU root by name today, so a user
`class Vector` or a missing prelude changes what `[i32]` MEANS. A desugar
target is not a name: the driver knows the builtin module's fid, and
`WellKnownDecls` is filled once per build from it. Same for `Null`, `Range`,
`Future`, `Yield`, `Ordering`, `Panic`, `string`.

`NameBindingVerifier` is N's exit test: no reachable `NamedIdentExpr`
survives with both slots null unless poisoned.

### 2.6 T TypeResolution [DONE]

`Sema/Resolve/TypeResolve.k`. Every type node gets `canonical`,
`type_flags`, per-segment `resolved_*`. Poisons on error.

**T never rewrites a node.** Slots only.

**Post-order, demand-driven.** `dispatch_type` resolves children first.
Aliases expand on demand (`_expand_alias`), memoized on ResolutionState;
`type A = B; type B = A` is one error with every link as a note.

**Alias chain depth is its own budget** (`--cmax-type-alias-depth`, default
64). The resolution stack's cap stays as the backstop and reports a
different message naming `--cmax-scope-depth`. Both are `R036`.

**An alias may not be more visible than what it names** (`R050`, at the
alias DECLARATION, walking the SYNTACTIC target).

**T never dispatches a node it does not own.** Foreign slots are READ
(`_foreign`); DAG order guarantees they are filled.

**Unqualified lookup uses the overlay of the TU the walk started in.**

What T decides:
- **Builtins** by token kind, before any lookup. `i32::x`: error.
- **`self`/`Self` in type position**: the innermost type scope's record with
  its own params as args. `Self::Inner` is a HEAD. `Self<T>` is an error.
- **Heads**: generic frames -> `ltypes` -> `unqualified(cur_dc)`.
- **`::` segments** step through `context_of(decl)`, alias expanded first,
  spelled for cross-TU probes. `T::Item` and `Foo<T>::Inner` are marked
  dependent and stopped (#5); M2 owns member-of-instantiation. The one
  exception is an IMPORTED `Foo` with concrete args: `Foo<Args>::Inner`
  steps into the registry instance, which `_scope_of` has clang fill first
  (`MemberLookup::ensure_filled`, IMPORTS.md §5); only a failed fill defers.
- **Final decl -> canonical**: GenericParamDecl -> `generic_param(owner,
  index)` on the REPRESENTATIVE; alias -> expand; nominal -> arity -> args
  by position and name -> defaults in the PRIMARY's scope -> #12. A written
  const/volatile wraps the canonical (`qualified()`); identity keeps it.
  Reference kinds put it on the referee.
- **Specialization registration** (#12) via `_register_specs_in`.
- **Structural kinds** ask the store. `[T; N]` canonicalizes only for a
  literal N. Dependence always flows up (`_component_ok`).
- **Receiver synthesis.** `ParamDecl::create_self` leaves `type_` null; T
  writes a `SelfType` with the enclosing record as canonical.
- **#68 refinement**; **enum underlying** must be a builtin integer;
  **`extend` target** resolved first; a record target becomes Self.

**Containers are records, not structural kinds** [DECIDED, MISSING].
`[T]`, `{K:V}`, `{T}`, `string` desugar to `builtin::Vector<T>` /
`builtin::Map<K,V>` / `builtin::Set<T>` / `builtin::String`, records found
by fid+path (above). `_resolve_vector/_set/_map` then produce
`record(Vector, [elem])`; the store's `vector()/set_of()/map_of()` and
MemberLookup's `_ext_by_shape` are deleted. `*T`, tuples, fn pointers and
`[T;]` stay structural. `[T; N]` is a C array (structural, FFI-shaped).
Until the migration lands both forms are live and `TypeUtil::vector_of`
etc. follow whichever the lang item says, so identity stays one domain.

**`unsafe *T` is a distinct canonical from `*T`** [DECIDED, MISSING, spec 2].
`PointerType::is_unsafe` enters the store's key. Without it the `unsafe *`
cast family is undecidable.

**`_selfs` holds a `*Type`, not a `*Decl`** [DECIDED, MISSING]. A record's
self is `record(canon, args)`; a structural target's self is its canonical.
Closes residue (f): `Self` inside `extend i32` stops being "outside a type
body".

Error homes carry real diag-table codes. `R020`-`R050` are the name/type
domain; `SC003`-`SC016` the Verify passes; `I003E` invariant violations.
`ImportResolution` still shares `R015E` across three errors.

`R001`/`SC001`/`U001` remain the per-category placeholder codes. The whole
of `Sema/Type/` is on `SC001E`/`SC001W`; a later sweep triages it. Anything
still on a placeholder must not ship in a stable release.

    [PARTIAL] `Foo<i32>::Inner` (concrete args) is marked IsDependent, not
    merely instantiation-dependent; ChainBinding then refuses
    `Foo<i32>::Inner::make()`.
    [PARTIAL] `_register_specs_in` descends type and module scopes only.

### 2.6a R RedeclMerge [DONE]

`Sema/Resolve/RedeclMerge.k`, inside the T stage after TypeResolution.
Merges FUNCTION redeclarations by signature (arity, canonical param types
in order, generic arity; return type EXCLUDED so a mismatch is a conflict;
const excluded for Kairo-authored decls, included for foreign). R(a) walks
frozen cells; R(b) matches `fn Class::method` against the in-class set.
Return-type / default / linkage / modifier agreement checked across the
chain. File scope permits repeats, a type body does not ([class.mem]).
A pair with DISTINCT signatures whose parameters all lower to the same C++
types is R052E at the second decl (`f(u64)` / `f(usize)` on a 64-bit
target: `usize` is `size_t`, the pointer-width unsigned integer), because
the emitted C++ would declare one function twice. Lowering compared is the
builtin table only (`usize`/`isize` vs the fixed-width integer of
`target.pointer_width`); records, pointers and refs compare by canonical as
identity does. Kairo-authored pairs only.

### 2.7 ChainBinding [DONE]

`Sema/Resolve/ChainBinding.k`, after RedeclMerge in the T stage. Walks
every `ChainExpr` left to right from an ANCHOR and binds each step:

    Module   -> `::` does table lookup (every reopened scope, unioned;
                re-exports via the module's overlay); `.` is an error
    Type     -> `::` does member lookup; `.` is an error
    Value    -> `.`/`->`/`?.`/`?->` peel the wrapper then member lookup on
                the canonical; `::` is an error
    NeedsInference / Errored -> record why, stop
    Dependent -> the three-regime rule below

Anchors: param/field/typed var -> Value; class/struct/enum/interface/
alias -> Type; `Self` bound to an ExtensionDecl -> Type (its target);
module -> Module; generic param -> Dependent (carrying its canonical);
call / inferred var / overload set / operator or tuple-index step ->
NeedsInference. An ffi alias denotes the header TUs' ModuleDecls, so it
anchors as Module like any reopened namespace.

**Two callers, one binder** [DECIDED, MISSING, spec 4]. `bind_step(chain,
st, anchor)` is public. ChainBinding calls it from its own walk with the
anchors it can compute from DECLARED types; the expression typer calls it
for every NeedsInference step once it knows the base's type, with
`anchor_for_value(decl, canonical)` / `anchor_for_type(t)`.

**The three regimes** [DECIDED, MISSING]. A step on a value whose canonical
is a bare `generic_param(owner, i)` reads `owner`'s `GenericParamDecl[i]`
and its bounds (inline `impl`/`derives` plus the owner's requires
conjuncts, read from `sc->bounds`):

    <T>            opaque. No members, no `::`. ERROR at the definition:
                   "'T' has no known members; add 'impl I' or ': type'".
    <T impl I>     member lookup over I (and I's derives), unioned across
                   bounds. Binds to I's REQUIREMENT decl. `derives B`
                   bounds expose B's members likewise. Definition-side
                   checking: the error lands on the template, not on the
                   40th instantiation.
    <T: type>      duck. Every step Dependent; M2 checks per instance.

A dependent COMPOSITE (`*T`, `[T]`, an unfilled `Foo<T>::Inner`) is still
Dependent under every regime; it has no scope to look into.

    [DONE] A dependent RECORD is still looked up by name (`self.x` in
    `class <T> Foo` binds to the field).
    [DONE] `Box<i32>::make()`: a type head with explicit args anchors as
    the registry instance -- positional, complete, no packs, no names.
    [DONE] Cross-TU probes are spelled, not imm-keyed.

Commit rule: one decl -> `resolved_decl`; all functions ->
`candidate_cell`; distinct non-function entities under one name ->
ambiguity error. Outcomes recorded per step in `ResolutionTrace`.

### 2.8 C checks [PARTIAL]

In order: `ConstraintExtraction`, `TypeCycleCheck`, `ExprTyper` (§2.9),
`ShadowCheck`. `OperatorSignatureCheck`, `ConformanceChecking`,
`ConstChecking`, `AccessCheck`, `ExtensionOrphanCheck` are stubs / missing.

`ConstraintExtraction` partitions each decl's canonical `requires` into
conformance constraints vs value predicates and writes the result to
`sc->bounds` keyed by owner decl [DECIDED, MISSING] -- the bound table
ChainBinding's dependent path and ConformanceChecking read.

    [DECIDED] TypeCycleCheck / LayoutPass treat a `RecordType::decl` that
    is `is_instance() && !instantiated` as "size unknown until M2", never
    as empty.
    [DECIDED] `ShadowCheck` runs after X; it is silent for a binding whose
    type is still null.

### 2.9 X ExprTyper [DONE, one-shot; bug list open]

`Sema/Type/`. THE expression typer: overload resolution, inference and
checking are ONE demand-driven system, not three passes -- picking an
overload needs the argument types, typing the call needs the overload, and
a "type mismatch" is what falls out when no conversion exists. Built like
ASTParse: `ExprTyper` derives the RAV and one mixin per concern; the
mechanisms with no traversal are components held by value.

    ExprTyper.k          driver, memo, `type_of(e, expected)`, side tables
    TypeUtil.k           component: read-only type/decl queries, rendering
    Conversion.k         component: the lattice + the implicit relation
    OverloadResolution.k component: candidates + args -> one decl
    ArgumentDeduction.k  component: unify / substitute / member_through /
                         replace_self
    LiteralTyping.k      mixin: §5 of the lattice
    OperatorTyping.k     mixin: §6 of the lattice + user operators
    CallTyping.k         mixin: callee shapes, ctor calls, promotion
    MemberTyping.k       mixin: chains (NeedsInference re-entry), subscripts
    CastTyping.k         mixin: the `as` family
    ControlTyping.k      mixin: if/match/try joins, closures, initializers,
                         lang-item desugars, binder-typing half of patterns
    StmtTyping.k         mixin: frames, `return`, decls that infer,
                         conditions, binders (what "TypeChecking" was)

**What X writes, and nothing else** (hard invariant #7 extended):
`Expr::type_`, `value_category`, `expr_flags`, `poisoned`; the inferred
type of a `VariableDecl` / `ClosureExpr` / expr-bodied `FunctionDecl` /
binder decl -- as the CANONICAL NODE ITSELF, which is self-canonical, so
every consumer reading `->canonical` is unchanged and no node is
allocated; and the promotion `candidate_cell -> resolved_decl` on a callee
(`NamedIdentExpr` or `ChainExpr::Step`). Never a new AST node.

**Four terminal states per expression.** typed (`type_` set); poisoned
(diagnosed, `type_` null); unknown (`IsInstantiationDependent` set,
`type_` null, not poisoned: dependent, foreign, or a hole a later pass
owns -- consumers skip checks on it); type/module-denoting (recorded in the
typer's side tables; only a callee or initializer head may read it).

**Memoized on the node.** `expected` is bidirectional only where a node
consumes it: literals, `null`, aggregate/named/anonymous initializers,
closures. A node has one parent, so one expected type, so the memo is
sound. Statement overrides call `type_of` with the expected type BEFORE
the RAV's own pre-order visit, which is then a memo hit.

**Conversion relation** (`Conversion.k`, normative source: the Primitive
Conversion Lattice). Two ranks: Exact = I; Converted = W, `T -> T?`,
`*Derived -> *Base` (same safety), `! -> anything`. No ordering inside
rank 2. `-fno-implicit-conv` demotes W to Converted->None here and nowhere
else. The primitive relation is rule-based (R1-R5, §4); the table-generated
`classify` with property tests is a tooling follow-up and these rules are
its oracle. bf16 -> f32/f64 is W (exact by construction; the doc table
omits bf16).

**Literals** (§5). Untyped until assigned. Expected type first, fit checked
AT the literal; default i32 -> i64 -> i128, then "too large without a
suffix". `-lit` folds the sign into the fit. Suffixed literals are typed
at the literal. Against a parameter, an untyped literal ranks Exact for
any type it fits (it TAKES the type; it is not converted) and is typed
with the parameter type after selection. The lexer's min-width guess is
not read for unsuffixed literals.

**Overload resolution** (`OverloadResolution.k`). Viability: placement
(positional, named, pack tail), defaults, every placed arg at rank <=
Converted, generic candidates deduce every non-pack param. Rank = worst
argument rank. Ties inside a rank are ambiguous, with ONE tiebreak that is
not a conversion ordering: among Exact winners a non-generic candidate
beats a generic one (otherwise `fn f(i32)` beside `fn <T> f(T)` is
ambiguous on every call). A fwd/def pair is one candidate (representative).
Specializations are skipped (paired later). Packs are accepted at
Converted and not deduced. Diagnostics: no viable (capped candidate notes),
ambiguous, not callable.

**Deduction** (`ArgumentDeduction.k`). Structural unify of the param's
canonical against the arg's, binding `(owner, index)`; conflicts fail,
there is no common-type search. Top level may succeed through the implicit
relation (Converted); inside a structure exact or nothing. `substitute`
rebuilds through the store and goes through the registry for a concrete
record. `member_through(recv, mt)` reads a member type through the
receiver's args. `replace_self(t, I, T)` reads an interface member through
a bound (`-> Self` is `T`).

**Calls** (`CallTyping.k`). Callee shapes: name (function / set / type ->
ctor / fn-pointer value), chain (method or set with the chain's receiver /
type -> ctor / fn-pointer value), anything else must be a fn pointer.
Constructors live in the type's own table under `DeclName::ctor()`; no
ctor + no args is the default ctor. Args are typed before resolution
except untyped literals (ranked by shape, typed after). Generic function
instances are registered in `InstantiationRegistry` (needs the function
arm, spec 7). Return type: declared -> canonical; `-> !` -> `Never`;
expr-bodied unannotated -> demanded under a rstate cycle guard.

**Chains** (`MemberTyping.k`). Per step: field/var/param -> declared type
through the receiver (LValue); variant -> the enum; method/set -> callable
(no type; legal only as a callee); nested type/alias -> type-denoting;
module -> nothing; `.0` -> the element; operator step -> callable via
`op_name`. `?.` peels and re-wraps. Callable expressions have no type: a
unique non-method function named as a value is its fn pointer; an overload
set as a value is an error at the use.

**Operators** (`OperatorTyping.k`). Builtins follow §6 exactly (`u32 + i32`
is an error; shifts unify the right operand alone; compound assignment
converts the right operand only). Comparison -> bool; `<=>` -> `Ordering`;
`??` on `T?` joins the inner with the right; `===` requires unifiable
operands. Non-primitives search the LEFT operand's members and extensions
under `op_name`, plus free operator functions found by ADL in the modules of
EITHER operand's type (`MemberLookup::associated_scopes`: the enclosing
modules up to, not including, the TU; pointers/refs/nullables peel; generic
args recurse). Members and frees rank in ONE set
(`OverloadResolution::resolve_mixed`), so a tie between them is ambiguous.
An unqualified call gets the same ADL over its arguments unless ordinary
lookup found a method.
Literal-on-one-side takes the other side's type. `&x` needs an lvalue and
yields `*T`; `*p` yields the pointee as an lvalue.

**Casts** (`CastTyping.k`). The written target is the result type, always.
Dispatch on (source, target), first match, no fallthrough:

    1. target = source + const           const cast, one-way
    2. target is `unsafe *X`             reinterpret; needs an unsafe ctx;
                                         source any pointer or an integer
    3. target `*X`, source `*S`, related upcast: static, redundant lint;
                                         downcast: ASSERTING (panic site,
                                         S must be polymorphic)
    4. target `*X?`, related             checked downcast, null on miss
    5. static ladder: lattice I/W (lint) / E / U (unsafe ctx) / X (error)
       -> plain enum <-> exact underlying -> `op as` on the source ->
       one-param ctor on the target -> error. `op as` beats ctor.

`as static` disables 3-4 and errors on a dynamic answer; a static downcast
is forbidden outright. `as const` asserts 1. `T? as T` is an error naming
`??` / `unwrap!()`; there is no collapsing cast. Pointer <-> integer: `ptr
as usize` needs no unsafe; `ptr as u8` is an error; `int as unsafe *T`
needs unsafe; `int as *T` is an error; `*T as unsafe *T` needs unsafe.
Asserting downcasts are recorded in `panic_sites()` for
PanicEffectChecking.

**Control** (`ControlTyping.k`). if/match/try as expressions join their
arms (`Conversion::join`: identical, one-way W, or Never on one side);
every arm must then convert to the join. Closures type as their fn-pointer
canonical; params must be annotated; return declared or inferred through
a frame. `a..b` -> `Range<elem>`; `await` on `Future<T>` -> `T`; `spawn`/
`thread` -> `Future<T>`; `sizeof`/`alignof` -> usize; `typeof x` is
type-denoting; `unsafe e` bumps the unsafe depth; `delete p` needs a
pointer. Named initializer: fields by name in the record's table, values
against the field type through the receiver. Anonymous initializer needs
an expected record type. Patterns: binders take the scrutinee's type,
literal/range patterns are checked against it, tuple patterns split;
constructor heads and exhaustiveness are PatternChecking's.

**Statements** (`StmtTyping.k`). One frame per function/closure body:
declared return type (null = infer) and the join of returns seen.
`return` without a value in a non-void function, with a value in a void
one, or at all in a `!` function: errors. `var x = e` writes the canonical
into `type_`; `var x` with neither type nor init is an error; `void`
initializers are errors. Conditions and guards must be `bool`. `for x in
xs`: element from the container / map (K,V) tuple / string char / Range
arg / `op in` (through `Yield<T>`); binders get it through their
shorthands. Destructuring by position or field name. Context bindings take
the value's type until ContextLowering. `yield`'s check against `yield T`
is YieldLowering's.

**What X does NOT do**: ADL through the global namespace (a type at TU
scope associates no scope, by design; see `_enclosing_modules`); pack deduction and
ranking; pattern head resolution and exhaustiveness (PatternChecking);
const-correctness, including assignment to const and const-cast validity
beyond "adds const" (ConstChecking); effect propagation (reads
`panic_sites()`); access control (AccessCheck); `yield` vs `yield T`;
the context-binding protocol; the `: type` regime (M2 re-check).

**Depends on** (blocking, spec items 1-7): `BuiltinKind::Never`;
`PointerType::is_unsafe` in the store key; `TypeCastExpr::cast_mode`;
`ChainBinding::{prepare, bind_step, anchor_for_value, anchor_for_type}`;
`SC001E`/`SC001W`; the schedule line in `Sema.k`; the registry's function
arm. Non-blocking: named-argument node; SemaDump `-- expression types --`
section; TypeQual enum path in `TypeUtil::syntax_is_const`.

**Tests** (`Tests/Sema/ExprTyper/`, golden `--print-sema` dumps):
`literals.k`, `operators.k` (the §6 table verbatim), `overloads.k`,
`chains.k`, `casts.k` (one line per ladder branch), `control.k`,
`bounds.k` (the three regimes), `nomono.k` (a generic body: every row
`<unknown>`, zero diagnostics -- if this one fails, something treats
dependent as failed, and that is the first bug to fix).

### 2.10 L, M1, M2 [MISSING]

Mono model: "Kairo enumerates and checks; C++ instantiates explicitly".
M1 walks `InstantiationRegistry::collect`; it creates nothing (T and X
did). M2 is the sync point: fills `Instantiated` nodes from their pattern,
selects partials, runs dependent conformance, resolves `T::Item`, and
**re-checks every `: type` body per instance** by re-running X over the
body with a `Deduction` seeded from the instance's args
(`ExprTyper::retype_instance`, a second entry point, not a pass). A duck
body whose member resolves to an EXTENSION member is an error there (see
§2b, the `: type` rule).

---

## 2b. Member lookup, extensions & OOP

**MERGE, not hide** [DONE]. `MemberLookup::lookup(canonical, name, out)`
walks own table -> extensions -> bases breadth-first, deduped, UNION.

**Extensions** [DONE]: indexed once per run over every parsed TU. Records
keyed by `RecordType::decl` (the primary for `extend <T> Vec<T>`); an
instance decl also consults its `instantiated_from`'s extensions. Generic
extensions on structural types keyed by shape (goes away with the
container migration); exact non-generic targets by canonical pointer.

**Instances** [DONE]: an explicit spec walks its own body. An unfilled
implicit instance walks its pattern (`instantiated_from`). An instance of an
IMPORTED template is filled by clang, not M2: the first lookup into it
calls `ForeignInstantiate::fill` (IMPORTS.md §5), after which it is
`instantiated` and walks its own table like any filled instance. A failed
fill is sticky and leaves it on the pattern.

**Extension visibility is import-scoped** [DECIDED, MISSING]. Today the
index is build-global: `import std::Vec` does nothing except get the file
into the build, and two libraries in the build both adding `push` make
every `v.push` ambiguous. An extension contributes to a TU's lookup iff
its fid is in that TU's transitive import set. One filter on `_index_decl`.

**The orphan rule** [DECIDED, MISSING -> `ExtensionOrphanCheck`, Checks
stage, after T]. A plain `extend X` must be in X's file. `extend X impl
I` may be in X's file or I's file. Keyed on `RecordType::decl` of the
target (an explicit spec's extend lives in the spec's file; an implicit
instance's in the primary's). A rejected extend is poisoned so the index
skips it. Consequences: reopened modules do not relax it (file, not
module); an FFI-extracted C++ type can never be plain-extended.

**An `impl` extend may contain only the interface's members** [DECIDED,
MISSING -> ConformanceChecking]. Without this `interface Dummy {}` in any
file re-opens every cross-file conflict the orphan rule exists to prevent.

**Interface-conformance methods are ordinary members at lookup**
[DECIDED]. `v.push(x)` resolves the `VectorI` method bare. Two interfaces
both declaring `push` on one type collide at the use; the qualified call
form (`VectorI::push(v, x)` / `v.VectorI::push(x)`, spelling TBD) is the
tiebreak and is required before the ambiguity diagnostic can suggest it.

**Every extension member lowers to a free function with an explicit
receiver** [DECIDED]. `extend Foo { fn m(self) }` is `m(Foo*)` in the
extension's module namespace; `a.push(19)` -> `std::Vec::push(&a, 19)`,
qualified from `resolved_decl` (IMPORTS.md §6.5). Receiver `Self*` /
`const Self*` from `fn f(self)` / `fn f(self) const`; a prvalue receiver
(`f().push(1)`) is materialized into a temporary by ExtensionLowering.
Extension methods are never virtual, never `override`, never a ctor.
Record extends follow the same rule; there are not two.

**Friend iff the extend is in the type's file** [DECIDED]. The type's
emitted definition carries `friend` declarations for exactly its
same-file extension members, so they see `priv`; an `impl` extend in the
interface's file is pub-only. The friend list is therefore closed at the
file, so a class definition is byte-identical in every TU (IMPORTS.md
invariant 12), library builds cache, and adding an extend downstream
rebuilds nothing upstream. EmitPlan: a class at Complete admits its
same-file extension members at Fwd, placed BEFORE the class definition
(tier 0), since a namespaced friend needs a prior declaration. Generic:
`template<class T> struct Box { template<class U> friend void m(Box<U>*); }`.

**Builtins are a compiler-shipped module** [DECIDED]. `builtins/Vector.k`
declares `struct <T> Vector { data, len, cap }` -- an FFI-backed record
spelled `kairo::builtins::vec` in C++ -- and std adds every method via
`extend <T> Vector<T> impl VectorI<T>` in std's own file, which the orphan
rule permits because `VectorI` is declared there. `VectorI` therefore
lists EVERY method (the impl-only rule above). A no-std user may still
`extend Vector impl MyInterface` from their own file. Consequence to
accept knowingly: Vector's representation is public API (struct fields
default pub; std's extend is not a friend), unless `prot` with
same-library provenance lands (AccessCheck).

**Generic bodies and extension members: witness structs** [DECIDED,
MISSING]. A generic body emits ONCE as a C++ template. Inside
`fn <T impl VectorI> f(x: T) { x.push(1) }` no single C++ spelling reaches
a different free function per `T` (ADL searches the type's namespace, not
the extension's). So every interface gets a witness template, every
conformance a specialization, and bound-member calls go through it:

    template <class Self, class... IfaceArgs> struct VectorI_witness;   // interface's TU
    template <class T> struct VectorI_witness<builtins::Vector<T>, T> {  // conformance's TU
        static void push(builtins::Vector<T>* self, T x) { std::Vec::push(self, x); }
    };
    template <class T> void f(T x) { VectorI_witness<T, ...>::push(&x, 1); }

Uniform for own-method and extension conformances (the former forwards
to `self->m(...)`); covers methods, operators, constructors, statics.
Keyed on `(Self, interface args)`, so `impl VectorI<i32>` and
`impl VectorI<string>` on one type coexist -- and therefore an interface
bound MUST name every interface argument (`T impl VectorI<U>`); an
unparameterized bound on a generic interface is an error, never inferred.
Non-generic code never touches a witness. Homes: ConformanceChecking
builds the table `(type, interface instance) -> requirement -> witness
decl`; `Codegen/Emit/EmitWitness.k` emits primary + specializations;
EmitPlan adds the edge instance -> witnesses Complete in the instance's
HOME TU (§7: one instantiation site); EmitIR routes a call whose callee
bound to an interface requirement (`semantic_dc` owner is an
`InterfaceDecl`) through the witness. A conformance must be in the
instantiating TU's import set (same rule as extension visibility).

**The `: type` rule** [DECIDED]. Duck typing is C++ duck typing: a `: type`
body sees own members only. Extension members are unreachable under
`: type` (M2's re-check reports it, naming the interface to bound with).
One dispatch system, and a precise meaning: "T is a C++ type; clang checks
the body".

**`needs_using`** [MISSING]. **Virtual dispatch** [MISSING]. **Access
control** is a late filter [MISSING].

## 3. Hard invariants

1. **Frozen means frozen.**
2. **One key space per TU.** Cross-TU goes through the spelling shim; the
   overlay consulted is the one of the TU the walk started in.
3. **One error, one home.** Import existence/ambiguity: I. Import access:
   N(b). Redefinition / conflicting kinds: N(a). Function redefinition /
   signature disagreement: R. Unresolved head, `Self` outside a type body
   (expression): N(b). Unknown type / arity / alias cycle / primitive
   misuse / no primary for a spec / spec redefinition / spec after
   instantiation: T. No member / wrong separator / member ambiguity /
   member of an unconstrained param: ChainBinding. Literal fit, operand
   unification, no viable overload, ambiguous call, bad cast, branch
   join, return-vs-signature, uninferrable decl: X. Dependent conformance:
   M2. Orphan violation: ExtensionOrphanCheck. Access: AccessCheck.
4. **Parallelism boundary.** P parallel. I, T, X DAG-ordered. N, M1 per-TU
   parallel. M2 sync. Store and registry are the shared mutable
   structures and both are locked.
5. **Dependent = deferred, not failed.** X's "unknown" state is this
   invariant on expressions; `nomono.k` is its test.
6. **Tracing never changes behavior.**
7. **One writer per fact.** Heads: N. Steps with declared bases:
   ChainBinding. Steps needing inference: ChainBinding's `bind_step`,
   called by X. Promotion cell->decl: X. `canonical`, `type_flags`,
   segment slots, `self` receiver type, `spec_kind` refinement, spec
   chain links, `instantiated_from` on specs: T. Function chains: R.
   `Expr::type_`, `value_category`, `expr_flags`, inferred decl slots: X.
   `instantiated_from` on implicit nodes: registry (then M2).
   `needs_using`: MemberLookup. `sc->bounds`: ConstraintExtraction.
8. **Canonical identity is build-wide, and cv-qualified: const i32 and i32
   are two canonicals.**
9. **T never rewrites nodes.** X never allocates nodes.
10. **Builtins are not names.**
11. **Imports are erased at N/CB.**
12. **`RecordType::decl` is the record whose body defines the instance.**
13. **T never dispatches a foreign node.** X reads a foreign decl's slots
    (return type, inferred var type) and never types a foreign body.
14. **The representative is the only identity.**
15. **The written cast target is the result type.** `a as T : T`, always.
16. **Two conversion ranks, unordered within rank 2.** The only tiebreak
    is non-generic over generic among Exact winners, and it is not a
    conversion ordering; `-fno-implicit-conv` can therefore remove a
    candidate but never select a different one (lattice §7).
17. **A generic parameter's regime is its declaration's.** `<T>` opaque,
    `<T impl I>` bounded, `<T: type>` duck. No inference of regime from use.
18. **A class definition is closed at its file.** Friends are same-file
    extension members only; nothing in another file changes the emitted
    definition.
19. **An interface bound names every interface argument.**
