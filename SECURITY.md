### Supported Versions

Helix supports and provides security updates for the following versions:

- **Latest Version:** The most recent stable release of Helix.
- **Previous Version:** The release immediately preceding the latest version.

Security updates for older versions may be provided on a case-by-case basis, depending on the severity of the issue and the feasibility of applying a fix to the older codebase.

#### Version Numbering

Helix uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) for its releases. The version number is formatted as `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, where:

- **MAJOR:** Incremented for incompatible API changes.
- **MINOR:** Incremented for new features that are backward-compatible.
- **PATCH:** Incremented for backward-compatible bug fixes.

We recommend always using the latest stable release to ensure you have the latest features and security updates.
